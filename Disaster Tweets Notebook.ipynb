    "The objective of this project is to classify tweets as either related to a disaster or not. This is a binary classification problem that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The data consists of tweets, each represented by textual content, and additional features such as keywords and location, though these may not always be present. The target variable is binary, indicating whether the tweet is disaster-related (1) or not (0).\n",

    "Training Data: 7,613 tweets, each labeled with a target variable (1 for disaster-related, 0 for non-disaster).\n",

    "Data Columns:\n",
